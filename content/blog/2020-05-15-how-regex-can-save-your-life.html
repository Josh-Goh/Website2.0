<h1><strong>How REGEX can save your life!</strong></h1>
<p>You’re probably wondering what REGEX is. You’re probably also wondering why it can save your life. Let me explain:</p>
<div id="python-background" class="section level2">
<h2>Python Background</h2>
<p>In the modern digital world it’s impossible to escape technology. It looms over society and has woven its way into the fabric of our culture, because lets face it: we’re all addicted and no one is getting over it any time soon. So, in the meantime, lets learn to adapt by embracing the new digital world!<br />
Let’s start with Python, one of the worlds most widely used, highly developed programming language. It’s a simple language and a complex language all at the same time. It’s beautiful, terrifying, and addicting.
To help you on your quest to master python, once variables, conditions, and for-loops have been thoroughly learned, I need to introduce you to REGEX – Regular Expressions!</p>

<h2>Regular Expressions: Why?</h2>
<p>So, I know that I said REGEX can save your life. However, that may have definitely been an exaggeration. But, that doesn’t mean REGEX will not make a significant impact on your coding career. RGEX is the coding equivalent of control + F on PC or command + F on Mac. I remember when I first learned about command + F:
c h a n g e d m y l i f e
I honestly can’t fathom using my computer without command + F anymore. If you don’t know what command + F is, in short, it is a life-saving tool that helps you search for text throughout a document, webpage, or file. Regex does the same, except it is able to extract information from text with specific texts and/or patterns. Cleaning data, reformatting, web scraping, and text replacement become a breeze with REGEX.</p>

<h2>Regular Expressions: How?</h2>
<p>re.match(r“expression”,string)</p>
<p>re.sub(pattern, repl, string)</p>
<p>re.search(r“expression”,string)</p>
<p>re.split(r“expression”,string)</p>
<p>re.findall(r“expression”,string)</p>
<p>match=re.match(r“expression”,string)
match.group()</p>
